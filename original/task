Task description to create DBM and OTC buckets using unallocated tokens on existing vesting buckets. 
1.	Create a backup of all data of users to be removed from seed, private and kol bucket containing: 
	a.	data for backup: 
		i.	address of user
		ii.	total claimed amount
		iii.	total allocated amount
		iv.	flag if user is part of vesting bucket (for reference)
	b.	contracts to verify: 
		i.	seed: 0xC780e9c48752cEbe21fb119E1A4EFEa57E4b0026
		ii.	private: 0x8377Ff4AEd639CBd75223aa9a9caB257864591Ca
		iii.	kol: 0x4fc18B68960A6ED7eab07451f0d755D857FF329d
	c.	the list of users to be removed from each bucket can be found here (one sheet per bucket)
2.	Create a script for removal of these users from buckets. 
	a.	Goal: 
		i.	Specified wallets must not be able to claim any more tokens from the corresponding buckets
			1.	Tokens on the buckets must be freed up after removal to be withdrawn via decreaseLiquidity(). The withdrawal will happen in the next step. 
	b.	Note: 
		i.	The function removeVesting() must be called without calling removeWalletListFromVesting() before. I.e. the vestings are removed while users are still attached to them. Otherwise the spentAmount is set to 0 				already and the amountForUser - spentAmount calculation for due payments in the future might be incorrect.
		ii.	The previous statement must be confirmed and not blindly followed. 
3.	Remove wallets based on scripts after confirmation by Olivier on execution. 
4.	Withdraw funds from buckets: 
	a.	seed (0xC780e9c48752cEbe21fb119E1A4EFEa57E4b0026): [amount to be inserted @Jaco Reijm]
	b.	private (0x8377Ff4AEd639CBd75223aa9a9caB257864591Ca): [amount to be inserted @Jaco Reijm]
	c.	kol (0x4fc18B68960A6ED7eab07451f0d755D857FF329d): [amount to be inserted @Jaco Reijm]
5.	Deploy 2 instances of "PlatformVesting" contract with the following steps: 
	a.	constructor parameters: 
		i.	adminPanel: 0xd2f2975aA43F2790B86EE89B4EF5392a338D8796
	b.	setTGEDate: 
		i.	deployment Timestamp
	c.	updateTokenAddress(): 
		i.	address: 0x9ff58067Bd8D239000010c154C6983A325Df138E
6.	Transfer previously withdrawn tokens to the newly deployed addresses: 
	a.	bucket A: [amount to be inserted @Jaco Reijm]
	b.	bucket B: [amount to be inserted @Jaco Reijm]
7.	Create vestings via insertVestingList
	a.	parameters to be specified
8.	Add wallets to vestings via InsertWalletListToVesting 
	a.	parameters to be specified
